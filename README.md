# stockticker

Stock ticker written in Go, with Bootstrap front-end.

The program is pulling live stock data for Google, Apple, and Microsoft stocks from the Google Finance JSON API and updates periodically.

Used to be live under https://go-stockticker.appspot.com/ but my Google SDK trial period ran out... 

Run it locally (with a working Go installation from the Go/src folder) by CD-ing into the application folder and then "go run main.go"
